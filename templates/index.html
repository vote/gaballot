        <p class="card-text">Runoff elections are all about turnout: we have <strong>XX days</strong> left to make sure every Georgia voter can make their voice heard. And we're behind: by this point in the November election, <strong>{{ stats.returned_general|commafy }} voters</strong> had already voted. But only <strong>{{ stats.returned_special|commafy }} voters</strong> have voted so far in the runoff. Help us catch up!</p>

        <p class='mb-0'>
          So far, <strong>{{ stats.applied_special|commafy }}</strong>
          ballots have been requested for the January special election and <strong>{{
          stats.returned_special|commafy }} ballots</strong> have been returned. There were <strong>{{
          stats.returned_general|commafy }} ballots </strong> returned early in the general
          election, so we are only
          <strong>{{ (100.0 * stats.returned_special / stats.returned_general)|round(1) }}%</strong> of the way there
          <em>(as of {{ stats.update_time.strftime('%B %-d at %-I:%M %p EST') }})</em>.
